# Online Courses

## Computer Science
- [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science): An introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

- [Computer Science 101 by Stanford](https://www.edx.org/course/computer-science-101): Introduction to Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. Play with little phrases of code to understand what computers are all about.

- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python by MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/): Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. 

## Deep Learning
- [Deep Learning Part 1, Practical Deep Learning For Coders](http://course.fast.ai/): Taught by Jeremy Howard (Kaggle's #1 competitor 2 years running, and founder of Enlitic). Learn how to build state of the art models without needing graduate-level mathâ€”but also without dumbing anything down.
- [Deep Learning Part 2, Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html): Where you'll learn the latest developments in deep learning, how to read and implement new academic papers, and how to solve challenging end-to-end problems such as natural language translation. You'll develop a deep understanding of neural network foundations

## Mathematics
- [Computational Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md): This course is focused on the question: How do we do matrix computations with acceptable speed and acceptable accuracy?
