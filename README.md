# Artificial Intelligence Engineer Roadmap

## Overview
This is resources for going from software engineer/non-software engineer to profressional in AI engineer.

## About Me
I'm a Thai Software Engineer who is really passionate to become entrepreneur, investor, and AI engineer. Was found Humaan.ai to bringing the AI to everyone to do incredible ways. 

Currently, I'm studying for a master's degree in Business Analytics and Data Sciences, where majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  at [National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA)](http://www.nida.ac.th/en/), Thailand.

# Online courses
## Aritificial Intelligence
- [Intro to AI](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) : Lecture and course materials for UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI

## Natural Language Processing
- [Stanford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (CS224n)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) : Natural language processing (NLP) is a crucial part of artificial intelligence (AI), modeling how people share information. In recent years, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance on many NLP tasks. In this course, students gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge neural networks for NLP.

## Machine Learning
- [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) : This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## Deep Learning

# Open Source Learning Projects
## Computer Vision
-  [Motion Heatmap Using OpenCV in Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/motion-heatmap-using-opencv-in-python) : This sample application is useful to see movement patterns over time. For example, it could be used to see the usage of entrances to a factory floor over time, or patterns of shoppers in a store.
- [Few-Shot vid2vid by NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid) : Pytorch implementation for few-shot photorealistic video-to-video translation. It can be used for generating human motions from poses, synthesizing people talking from edge maps, or turning semantic label maps into photo-realistic videos. The core of video-to-video translation is image-to-image translation. Some of our work in that space can be found in pix2pixHD and SPADE.
- [Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector for Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/jwchoi384/Gaussian_YOLOv3) : Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector Using Localization Uncertainty for Autonomous Driving (ICCV, 2019)
