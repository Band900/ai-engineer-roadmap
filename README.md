## Example Project
### Computer Vision
-  [Motion Heatmap Using OpenCV in Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/motion-heatmap-using-opencv-in-python) : This sample application is useful to see movement patterns over time. For example, it could be used to see the usage of entrances to a factory floor over time, or patterns of shoppers in a store.
